# Food-and-Beverage-analysis
Project Overview

This project is part of the Codebasics Resume Project Challenge (Food & Beverage Industry).
The task was to help the marketing team of a beverage company understand consumer behavior, brand perception, and purchase preferences through survey data analysis.

As the data analyst, my goal was to build a Tableau dashboard that delivers actionable insights on customer demographics, price sensitivity, ingredient expectations, and marketing effectiveness — helping the brand refine its product and marketing strategies.

Tools & Technologies
